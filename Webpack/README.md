- Webpack takes files of different types (scripts, images, styles) and bundles them into just a few files 
- Also manages dependencies 
- Webpack is responsible for bundling React apps into just a few build files (`npm run build`)
  - minifies CSS and JS files in production
  - it also does this in the development mode (`npm start`); bundles css into the JS files
